# 18240-Lab-3

This is a lab demonstrating how for relatively complex circuits, most automated systems can do a better job simplifying a circuit than a human can as well as building, analysing, and working with Moore-type finite state machines.

These machines have eight states with two inputs and work though many of the cases.
